                <h2>Experience Builder</h2>
                <p> Using ESRI ArcGIS Online Experience Builder for indoor navigation and routing has proven effective in several aspects while presenting challenges in others. One success discovered by Group 4 is the functionality of the many widgets within Experience Builder, which significantly enhance indoor navigation experiences. The widget which would be most useful for indoor navigation and room-level information would be the "Navigation" widget. However, a crucial requirement for this feature to work is the necessity for indoor spaces to be "floor aware." Unfortunately, the UDOT floor plans did not have this function - that the mapping system must recognize and differentiate between various floors within a building. While this requirement ensures accurate indoor navigation, it also poses a limitation as not all indoor spaces are inherently floor-aware. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, Group 4 discovered many, other widgets that were successful in aiding the user to learn about the floorplans and the rooms within them. The "Swipe" widget allows users to flip between floors to see changes within the layouts, while the "Search" function allows users to input what they are looking for and outputs are listed for them (this can be any attribute provided in the data - we utilized room name and floor number).</p>
                <p> Additionally, the "Routing" widget demonstrates versatility by providing directions for outdoor spaces without the constraint of floor awareness. Our sample outdoor data of Newmarket Parks allows the user to navigate from point A to B with ease. </p>
                <p>We learned that Experience Builder offers the advantage of displaying maps in both 2D and 3D formats, with the latter utilizing ArcScene. This capability significantly enhances the visualization aspect of navigation, particularly in complex indoor environments where spatial orientation is critical. By using 3D visualization, users gain a realistic representation of indoor spaces. </p>

                <h2>ArcScene</h2>
                <p>ArcScene Viewer was proven to be useful by creating 3D versions of UDOT's 2D floorplans. We discovered this can be done by extruding your features - allowing to convert your 2D features into 3D by assigning them a height attribute (based on the floor plans)</p>
                <p>ArcScene also allows the user to create snapshots of different angles and view specific layers. ArcScene also has neat features that can show the user what the 3D render would look like at certain times of day (sunlight/shadows) and in different weather conditions (snow/rain)</p>
                <p>A disadvantage found would be the lag and somewhat blurry, pixeled view of the 3D floorplans when trying to navigate and manipulate the feature too quickly. Slowly rotating and zooming in/out of the building worked, but quick movements seemed to slow down the viewers capabilities. If utilizing a large building/multiple buildings - this is good to keep in mind. We also continued to experience lag when bringing in the Scene into Experience Builder and Dashboards.</p>

                <h2>Another ESRI product :) </h2>

                <h2>ArcGIS Indoors</h2>
                <p> Though we were unable to experiment with ArcGIS Indoors - we explored it’s documentation to gain a better understanding of it’s use in the indoor mapping world. From a 2D floorplan - ArcGIS Indoors can extract features such as walls and doors, as well as annotate extracted features with information such as room name and use. Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph-based methods - these models learn to recognize and interpret the features of the newly created indoor environment. </p>
                <p> Map generation within ArcGIS Indoors allows for detailed layouts, pathways and navigation between rooms and floor levels. ArcGIS Indoors even allows for the user to determine precise location through localization techniques such as Wi-Fi signals. </p>
                <p>ArcGIS Indoors allows for the development of user-friendly interfaces and applications to allow access to the indoor mapping - providing navigation instructions, route planning, point of interest look-up and real-time updates.</p>
