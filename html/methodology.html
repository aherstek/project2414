                <p>A solution that makes it easy to display your maps and data in an engaging manner. By choosing on of many templates then 
                    setting basic configurations, you can quickly share an application that suits your audiences needs. </p>
                <h2>Major Learning</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right template and going beyond the Express setup functionality allows for a more comprehensive app to be set up. 
                    While ArcScene worked well, this brings in more widgets for the client/audience to work with. While not available for the UDOT data (because it isn't floor aware), 
                    there is the extended ability to add in Building Explorer and Floor Filter interactivity, which would be a great tool for our project. Instant App is a great to
                    get familiar with the data and to get a better understanding of it in a quick, simple & interactive manner. 
                </p>
                <h2>What didn't work?</h2>
                <p>Due to not being able to work with floor aware plans, the Filtering interaction may be more inefficient. Filters need to be set up for each floor for the user. For larger buildings
                    this can be a daunting task without automation. The particular layout, while did hit a majority of our desired solution points, wasn't able to deliver routing like Experience Builder or Dashboards
                    could. This solution may not be aimed at our audience, however, this would be a great tool for showrooms or public viewing of the clients proposal/work. The client would generally
                    like/need slightly more in-depth functions for working and viewing the data.

                <h2>Major Learning</h2>
                <p>Using a large dataset tends to cause lag within Experience Builder, creating an underwhelming experience for the user. </p>
                <h2>What didn't work?</h2>
                <p>There is no setting that allows for the select widget's highlight colour to be changed. The default is a very pale blue. In turn, when searching for a room - the pale outline highlighting the room is hard to find.</p>
