                <p>A solution that makes it easy to display your maps and data in an engaging manner. By choosing on of many templates then 
                    setting basic configurations, you can quickly share an application that suits your audiences needs. </p>
                <h2>Major Learning Outcomes</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right template and going beyond the Express setup functionality allows for a more comprehensive app to be set up. 
                    While ArcScene worked well, this brings in more widgets for the client/audience to work with. While not available for the UDOT data (because it isn't floor aware), 
                    there is the extended ability to add in Building Explorer and Floor Filter interactivity, which would be a great tool for our project. Instant App is a great to
                    get familiar with the data and to get a better understanding of it in a quick, simple & interactive manner. 
                </p>
                <h2>What didn't work?</h2>
                <p>Due to not being able to work with floor aware plans, the Filtering interaction may be more inefficient. Filters need to be set up for each floor for the user. For larger buildings
                    this can be a daunting task without automation. The particular layout, while did hit a majority of our desired solution points, wasn't able to deliver routing like Experience Builder or Dashboards
                    could. This solution may not be aimed at our audience, however, this would be a great tool for showrooms or public viewing of the clients proposal/work. The client would generally
                    like/need slightly more in-depth functions for working and viewing the data.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A solution designed to allow users to view the UDOT building in 3D, find room locations utilizing a search bar, with the option to find room-level information. </p>
                <h2>Major Learning Outcomes</h2>
                <p>Experience Builder provides a plethora of ‘widgets’ - which you drag and drop into the desired layout,  creating a custom dashboard. The widget which would be most useful for indoor navigation and room-level information would be the "Navigation" widget. However, a crucial requirement for this feature to work is the necessity for indoor spaces to be "floor aware." Unfortunately, the UDOT floor plans did not have this function - that the mapping system must recognize and differentiate between various floors within a building. The "Swipe" widget allows users to flip between floors to see changes within the layouts, while the "Search" function allows users to input what they are looking for and outputs are listed for them (this can be any attribute provided in the data - we utilized room name and floor number).</p>
                <h2>What didn't work?</h2>
                <p>When using some widgets, you are unable to stack more than one onto the same map (such as Swipe and Search). This can be a bit of a constraint - as having to put multiple of the same map to maximize widgets used takes up space within the dashboard, as well as looking repetitive. There is no setting that allows for the Search widget's highlight colour to be changed. The default is a pale blue. In turn, when searching for a room - the pale outline highlighting the room is somewhat hard to find. Using a large dataset tends to cause lag within Experience Builder, creating an underwhelming experience for the user. UDOT floorplans not being “floor aware” also limited our ability to utilize the navigational and routing widgets.</p>
