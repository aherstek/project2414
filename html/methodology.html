                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A basic solution that creates 3D scenes, brining your maps to life and helps visualize different scenarios. </p>
                <h2>Major Learning Outcomes</h2>
                    <p>ArcScene Viewer was proven to be useful by creating 3D versions of UDOT's 2D floorplans. We discovered this can be done by extruding your features - allowing to set your 2D line features as 3D wall features by assigning them a height attribute (based on the floor plans)
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>ArcScene also allows the user to create snapshots of different angles and view specific layers with 3D surrounds. For 
                        <a href="https://arcg.is/1LSWye" target="blank">Newmarket Parks</a>, by brining it into a 3D scene, it really gives the viewer a sense of the topography and surrounding area. ArcScene also has neat features that can show the user what the 3D render would look like at certain times of day (sunlight/shadows) and in different weather conditions (snow/rain). 
                    By creating snapshots, or slides, 2D viewing of the building layers can also be achieved for the floor plans. These slides are then also able to be brought in to other applications. 
                    </p>
                    
                <h2>What didn't work?</h2>
                    <p>A disadvantage found would be the lag and somewhat blurry, pixeled view of the 3D floorplans when trying to navigate and manipulate the feature too quickly. Slowly rotating and zooming in/out of the building worked, but quick movements seemed to slow down the viewers capabilities. If utilizing a large building/multiple buildings - this is good to keep in mind. We also continued to experience lag when bringing in the Scene into Experience Builder and Dashboards. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This product is more of a building block, but not a final solution. It has limited use, but is easily enhanced by brining it into other solutions.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A solution designed to allow users to view the UDOT building in 3D, find room locations utilizing a search bar, with the option to find room-level information. </p>
                <h2>Major Learning Outcomes</h2>
                <p>Experience Builder provides a plethora of ‘widgets’ - which you drag and drop into the desired layout,  creating a custom dashboard. The widget which would be most useful for indoor navigation and room-level information would be the <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/experience-builder/latest/configure-widgets/near-me-widget.htm" target="blank">Near Me</a> or <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/experience-builder/latest/configure-widgets/directions-widget.htm" target="blank">Directions</a> widget. However, a crucial requirement for these features to work is the necessity for indoor spaces to be "floor aware." Unfortunately, the UDOT floor plans did not have this function - that the mapping system must recognize and differentiate between various floors within a building. The <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/experience-builder/latest/configure-widgets/swipe-widget.htm" target="blank">Swipe</a> widget allows users to flip between floors to see changes within the layouts, while the <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/experience-builder/latest/configure-widgets/search-widget.htm" target="blank">Search</a> function allows users to input what they are looking for and outputs are listed for them (this can be any attribute provided in the data - we utilized room name and floor number).</p>
                <h2>What didn't work?</h2>
                <p>When using some widgets, you are unable to stack more than one onto the same map (such as Swipe and Search). This can be a bit of a constraint - as having to put multiple of the same map to maximize widgets used takes up space within the dashboard, as well as looking repetitive. There is no setting that allows for the Search widget's highlight colour to be changed. The default is a pale blue. In turn, when searching for a room - the pale outline highlighting the room is somewhat hard to find. Using a large dataset tends to cause lag within Experience Builder, creating an underwhelming experience for the user. UDOT floorplans not being “floor aware” also limited our ability to utilize the navigational and routing widgets.</p>

                <p>An open source approach to indoor navigation.</p>
                <h2>Major Learning Outcomes</h2>
                <p>Exploring this part of the solution was a very good lesson learned. Basically, The application of <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS</a> was to create floorplans, add/edit floor level information in attribute table, create navigation layers and export the features into json files. <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>, an open source JavaScript library for interactive mapping solution employs the json items from QGIS to develop a web based solution for indoor navigation. The overall QGIS proceess includes creating features and <a href="https://github.com/wrld3d/wrld-indoor-maps-api" target="blank">Indoor Mapping Tool</a>, a web map based solution. </p>
                <h2>What didn't work?</h2>
                <p>UDOT floorplans being a propitary data in ArcGIS Server, we were unable to make further edits on the floor plan. For generating a 3D perspective, it is mandatory in QGIS to have advance editing tool active. However, this functionality didn't work out for we didn't have editing rights to UDOT floorplan. Having only limited functionality on the floorplan and not being able to access <a href="https://github.com/wrld3d/wrld-indoor-maps-api" target="blank">Indoor Mapping Tool</a>, this solution quite didn't work out for us.  </p>
