                <h2>Ideal</h2>
                <p>Using a web-based solution, staff of UDOT should be able to access current room-level information (number of desks per room, room use, etc.), edit/update information as needed, and navigate between rooms.</p>
                <h2>Reality</h2>
                <p>Staff currently do not have access to one single digital platform that provides room-level information for their business readily available at their fingertips.</p>
                <h2>Consequences</h2>
                <p>Issues can arise during emergency situations such as accessing the total number of staff in each room or navigating emergency exits. Staff submitting maintence requests or organizing maintenance/cleaning schedules is not available in one place. Navigation between rooms is currently paper-based and outdated.</p>
                <h2>Proposal</h2>
                <p>Create a dashboard application that allows internal staff to view, edit and update room-level information of their workplace, as well as act as a navigational tool.</p>
