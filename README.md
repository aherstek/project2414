## Ideal 
Using a web-based solution, staff of UDOT should be able to access current room-level information (number of desks per room, room use, etc.), edit/update information as needed, and navigate between rooms. 

## Reality
Staff currently do not have access to one single digital platform that provides room-level information for their business readily available at their fingertips. 

## Consequences
Issues can arise during emergency situations such as accessing the total number of staff in each room or navigating emergency exits. Staff submitting maintence requests or organizing maintenance/cleaning schedules is not available in one place. Navigation between rooms is currently paper-based and outdated. 

## Proposal
Create a dashboard application that allows internal staff to view, edit and update room-level information of their workplace, as well as act as a navigational tool. 

## Technology Used
ESRI (ArcGIS Online, Indoors, Dashboard/Experience Builder)
